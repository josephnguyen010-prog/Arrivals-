 * The app's own bar: the wordmark, the sections, and the things you can do from
 * anywhere — one line, with the sections centred in the space between the two.
 *
 * The sections belong here rather than in the page: once the profile block
 * stopped sitting above them they were no longer one person's shelves under
 * their name, they were the app's navigation. Centred rather than tucked in
 * beside the wordmark, they read as their own group instead of as a tail on the
 * title, which is what lets them share a line with the one red button without
 * either losing. It holds to about 830px, where they drop to a line of their
 * own rather than squash.
