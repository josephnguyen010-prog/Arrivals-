# Arrivals

Letterboxd, but for cities. Rate the places you've been, log every trip separately, and keep a
ranking that's built from comparisons rather than guesswork.

**Arrivals is a working title**, named for the arrival stamp in a passport and the board in an
airport. It replaced `Postmark`, which collided with ActiveCampaign's transactional email service —
a developer-facing product, and so the worst possible audience to share a name with.

Worth knowing if the name comes up again: the stamp-flavoured names are saturated by direct
competitors in exactly this category. **Stamped: Travel Tracker & Map**, **Stamp: Travel Tracker**,
**Stampie** and **WanderStamp** all already track places you've been, and **Passage** is a travel
app too. `Arrivals` and `Port of Entry` were the passport words left standing.

The trade-off: a common English word is hard to trademark and hard to search for. `Port of Entry` is
more ownable and more literally passport, but it's three words and shortens badly.

## Running it

```bash
npm install
npm run dev      # http://localhost:5173
npm test         # ranking logic
npm run build    # typecheck + production build
```

## Where it's deployed

A copy of the build is served from the portfolio at `/arrivals/`. Two things make that work, and
both matter if you move it anywhere else:

- `base: "./"` in `vite.config.ts`, so asset paths are relative and survive any sub-path.
- `HashRouter` rather than `BrowserRouter`. GitHub Pages has no SPA fallback, so a real path like
  `/arrivals/cities` would 404 on refresh. The hash never reaches the server.

To update the copy in the portfolio: `npm run build`, then replace `public/arrivals/` there.

## The idea

Three decisions carry the design.

**A rating and a ranking are different things.** You give a city a star rating outright — tap the
stars on any city page, or the pencil on a card in Cities. But when
you land on a rating you've already given something else, the app asks which of the two you
preferred, and inserts the new city by binary search. Placing into a rating that holds *n* cities
costs `ceil(log2(n + 1))` questions — three for eight cities, four for sixteen — so it stays a
question or two in practice. The ordering that falls out is a real ranked list, not a pile of ties.

**You rate the city, but you log the trip.** Films get watched a hundred times a year; cities get
visited maybe three. A city-shaped log would be too quiet to be worth opening. So the unit is a
visit, and the MyPassport screen shows them in order, with repeat trips marked `↻ visit 2`. It's
ruled off by year rather than by month: at this rate of travel a month header sits over one row
almost every time, which splits the date in two and strands the day in the margin, a long way from
the header that gives it meaning. Years actually group, and each row carries its date whole.

**Cities are a finite, canonical catalogue.** That's the property Letterboxd relies on and
restaurant apps have to fight for. A few thousand cities from GeoNames or Wikidata and the
catalogue problem is solved.

## Profile

The landing screen: your four favourite cities, recent activity, and previews of Departures and
MyPassport down the side. Favourites are chosen and ordered by hand rather than taken from the top
of the ranking — the city you'd tell someone about isn't always the one you scored highest, and
that gap is the interesting part.

No bio block and no promo panel, which is what the reference had and this doesn't need.

## Two screens, split by whether you've been
**Cities** is only where you've been. A grid two-thirds full of grey `not been` cards was noise
rather than a catalogue, so unvisited cities are not there at all.

**Departures** is only where you're going: a count, a filter row, one grid. Nothing else. An earlier
version carried a search box and a second grid of the whole catalogue, which made one screen do
two jobs.

That leaves the catalogue needing a home, so it lives in **search in the top bar** — find any city,
open it, or add it to the board with the `+` without leaving the results. Same arrangement as a
watchlist: the list is the list, and finding things is a separate act.

Logging a visit moves a city across on its own — off the board, into Cities.

## Spots

Under every city, the things you'd actually tell someone about, filed under **Favourite restaurant**,
**Hidden gem**, **Must-see view** or **Skip it**. Each takes an optional link and an optional photo,
and each can be edited afterwards — the pencil reopens the form it was written in, category
included, so a spot can be re-filed as well as reworded. Removing lives inside that form now; the
only thing you could previously do to a spot you'd written was throw it away.

Two things worth knowing about how they're stored:

- **Photos are downscaled before they're stored, never after.** A phone photo is several megabytes
  and `localStorage` is a few for the whole origin, so `downscaleImage` caps the longest edge at
  900px and re-encodes as JPEG, which lands around 60–120KB. The total is checked against a budget
  before every write, and the form reports a full store instead of failing silently.
- **Pasted links are validated, not trusted.** `safeUrl` accepts a bare host and assumes https, but
  returns null for anything that doesn't resolve to http(s) — `javascript:` above all — so the save
  button stays disabled and nothing unsafe is ever put in an `href`. Links render with
  `rel="noreferrer noopener"`. It's tested.

The section ships with sample spots for a dozen cities. The places are real and well known; the
opinions are written for the prototype and are nobody's actual recommendations. Links use Google's
documented Maps search URL, which resolves for any query — no invented place ids to rot. Sixteen of
the twenty-one carry a Commons photograph of the place itself; the five Commons has nothing for are
left without one rather than illustrated with a stand-in.

`Skip it` was my addition to the three categories. A negative recommendation is genuinely useful
and rare in travel apps, but it changes the tone — drop it from `SPOT_CATEGORIES` if you'd rather
the section stayed positive.

## Notes on a city

The header runs in three columns: the stamp, the title block with your rating under the name, and
the facts beside them — how the place got there, what to eat, what to see, and one thing worth knowing. That
third column is where the title block was leaving the page empty, which for a city you haven't been
to is nearly all of it.

They stay subordinate by type rather than by position: mono labels, muted body, ruled off, against a
name set in 36pt. A spell as a band under the whole header tested the other theory and proved it the
wrong way round — it read fine, and left the column it came out of empty again.

The facts are a hand-written table in `data/facts.ts`, keyed by the same city ids as the catalogue,
and a test asserts every city has every field filled and no two cities share a fun fact. That's a
coverage check, not a fact check: the entries are deliberately kept to what's firmly established and
short enough to read in one pass. Like the catalogue itself, the real version of this comes from
Wikidata.

A separate line saying what the city was to its country — capital, former capital, second city —
came out again: the eyebrow above it already names the country, so on half the catalogue it was
saying Taiwan three times in three lines. The ones that said something the eyebrow doesn't went into
the history sentence instead, where they read as history rather than as a label: Kyoto was the
capital for a thousand years, Rio until Brasília, Istanbul's is Ankara now, and Parliament still
sits in Cape Town. The plain state capitals were left out — *Capital of Colorado* is true and inert,
and if the state matters the fix is a state in the catalogue, not a clause in the prose.

A column of names — people born in or made by the city — was there first and came out again. It
needed a caption to be honest, because for a lot of cities the person the place is known for arrived
rather than started there, and a caption on a list of three names is a lot of hedging for something
nobody asked about the city. One fact that's actually surprising does more.

## Your own photo

Every city ships with a Commons photograph, and every one of them can be replaced from **Change
photo** on the city page. Yours then shows everywhere that city appears — the card, the stamp, the
passport row, the comparison screen — because it all resolves through one `CityPhoto` component
rather than reading `city.photo` directly.

Two details that matter more than the feature does:

- **The credit changes with the photo.** CC BY obliges the credit to reach whoever is looking at the
  picture. Once the picture is yours there's nobody to credit, and still naming the original
  photographer would be worse than saying nothing — so the line becomes *Your photo*, and comes back
  when you put the default back.
- **It reuses the spot-photo pipeline exactly.** Same 900px cap, same JPEG re-encode, same up-front
  budget check, now shared out of `lib/images.ts` and `lib/quota.ts` rather than living inside
  `lib/spots.ts`. A full set of 44 replacements sits inside the budget.

`ranking.ts` is pure functions over a `LogState`, so the interesting behaviour is testable without
rendering anything. `npm test` covers placement at the top, bottom and middle of a rating, the
question-count bound, re-rating a city, and the case where a city would otherwise be compared
against itself.

## Design

Airmail. Red and blue together as a barber stripe rather than a single accent colour, on kraft
paper or navy ink. Palatino for the wordmark, Helvetica for the interface, and Courier for
anything that's data — dates, countries, ratings — which is the vernacular of customs forms
and luggage tags. Both themes are first-class; the toggle in the top bar overrides the OS setting.

The perforated stamp is the one loud element, so it's kept to the city page and the moment a visit
is logged. Everywhere else cities are quiet rectangles, because a grid is for scanning.

**One loose end after the rename.** The identity was drawn for a postal name — the perforated edge
is a postage stamp, and the diagonal red-and-blue rule is an airmail envelope. The circular
cancellation mark survives the move intact, because a passport entry stamp genuinely looks like
that: a ring, the port of entry arced over the top, the date across the middle. The perforations and
the airmail stripe are the parts still arguing for the old name. Moving them to a visa-page
treatment — guilloche, a torn edge, a document number — would settle it, but that's a redesign
rather than a rename.

## State of it

Working: rating, the comparison flow, the ranking, filters and sorts, Departures, spots with links
and photos, city notes, replacing a city's photo with your own, the MyPassport screen, per-city
pages, lists you can create and reorder, both themes, and persistence to `localStorage`.

The sheet has no scroller of its own. A tall panel used to grow a bar down its own edge, inside the
sheet and beside the content; the veil scrolls the whole sheet instead, and its own bar is hidden.

The search shows nothing until you type. An untouched field used to open onto all 44 cities in
alphabetical order, which is a list nobody reads — and it left the first one highlighted, so Enter
logged a trip to Amsterdam you hadn't chosen. The sheet is pinned near the top of the veil rather
than centred, so growing as you type moves only its bottom edge.

Logging is two screens, not four: find the city, then say everything about the trip on one panel —
when you went, how it was, a note, and one spot worth remembering. Only the city is required. The
comparisons that follow are the app placing the rating, not another question about the visit.

The date is a field you open rather than a screen you pass through. Behind it is a calendar built
here rather than an `<input type="date">`, which brings the OS's own styling with it — the one
element on the page that can never be made to match. `‹ ›` steps a month, `«  »` a year, future days
are disabled, and the grid takes one tab stop with arrow keys inside it, because tabbing past
thirty-one days to reach the one you want is not a date picker. `lib/dates.ts` holds the arithmetic —
the month-step clamp that stops *Previous* from landing you forwards, and the leap-year cases — and
it's tested.

A typed date field above the calendar was tried and taken out again: it parsed a good spread of
formats and had to refuse `8/12` as ambiguous, which is a lot of apparatus in front of a control
that was already two clicks.

**Your review** sits directly under the city header, with **what people say** beneath it. Both are
about the place rather than about a trip, which is the same split the app makes with the rating: a
visit's note is what one trip was like, a review is what you make of the city. Writing one is a
sheet with a single field; it can be edited or deleted from the same place afterwards. It lives on
the log as `reviews`, keyed by city, and older saves without the field load with an empty one.

The **Activity** screen is a feed of what happened rather than a second copy of what was said: one
scannable row an entry — who, where, when, what they gave it — linking to the city page where the
review itself lives. It carried the full text before, which meant nineteen reviews stacked up on one
screen and every one of them printed twice in the app.

**What people say** sits under your review, above your own spots: it is about the place
rather than about your trip. The heading carries the average of the ratings beside it. The friends
and their notes are invented, and there are enough of them now that most cities have one — a section
that says *nobody you follow has been* on forty of forty-four cities is a feature you can't see.

Your note is the one thing the app used to give everyone but you. The feed's invented friends had
reviews from the start; your own log held a rating, some dates and a few spots, and nowhere to say
what a place was actually like. It shows on the city page beside each visit and under the city's
name in the passport.

Nothing in the log flow is thrown away once a rating is picked. The comparisons only decide where a
city sits inside its rating, so leaving them — Escape, the veil, **Skip the rest** — keeps the visit
and files it by the answers given so far, placed mid-bracket rather than at the top of the rating,
which is the least the answers claim. `settleEarly` in `ranking.ts` is that rule, and it's tested.

Not built yet:

- **Accounts and a real social graph.** The feed and the friends' notes are invented. Swapping
  `lib/storage.ts` for a Supabase table is the whole migration for the log itself; the social half
  is a real build.
- **More than 44 cities.** The catalogue is still a hand-written array; the real one is GeoNames.
  The facts table in `data/facts.ts` is hand-written against the same ids and has the same problem.
- **Sharing a list.** Lists exist and are editable, but only in your own browser. Making one
  shareable is the point of them and needs the backend.
- **Your own photo per visit.** Spots and cities take photos now; a single visit still doesn't, so
  ten years of trips to one city share one picture.

## Photos

All 44 default city photographs and the 16 spot photographs are CC0, public domain or
attribution-only, and the credit renders on the city page because CC BY requires it to reach
whoever is looking at the photo — until the photo is replaced with one of your own, at which point
there is nobody to credit and the line says so. Share-alike is deliberately excluded: it obliges derivative works to carry the same licence,
which is a problem once photos sit inside a product. [CREDITS.md](CREDITS.md) has both tables and
the rule for adding a city.

## The open question

Ratings bunch at the top. Nobody flies somewhere hoping to file it under two stars, so the upper
bands get long while the bottom stays empty, and the comparison work concentrates in a couple of
places. Beli avoids this because you eat somewhere mediocre every week.

A distribution chart on the Cities screen used to show this, but it earned too much room for
something you would look at twice, so it came out. The filter bar covers the same ground more
cheaply: `Rating` filters to a band or an exact value, which answers "how much is stacked at 4½"
by just showing you. If the top bands do swallow everything once there's real data, the fix is
probably finer resolution up there rather than more stars overall.
