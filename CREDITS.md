# Photo credits

Every city photograph in `src/assets/cities/` comes from [Wikimedia Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org),
cropped to 3:2 and re-encoded. No other changes were made.

**All 44 are CC0, public domain or attribution-only.** Share-alike images were deliberately
excluded: CC BY-SA obliges derivative works to carry the same licence, which is a problem once
photos sit inside a product.

The CC BY images require attribution to reach the person looking at the photo, so the credit is
rendered on each city's page in the app — see `src/components/PhotoCreditLine.tsx`. This file is
the full record; the app is what actually discharges the obligation.

## Spot photographs

The sixteen photographs in `src/assets/spots/` come from Commons under the same rule, cropped
square and re-encoded at 240px. Each one shows the place the spot names; the five seeded spots
Commons has no photograph of are left without one rather than illustrated with something else.

They are bundled files rather than the inline data URLs a spot you add yourself carries. The
seeded list is written back to localStorage the first time you touch it, and sixteen data URLs
would take a large bite out of the storage budget on their own.

`SPOT_PHOTO_CREDITS` in `src/data/credits.ts` is keyed by the bundled asset URL rather than by spot
id, so inserting a spot cannot shift a credit onto the wrong photograph. The credits render as one
line under the Spots section on the city page.

## Adding a city

Keep the rule: **CC0, public domain, or CC BY only.** No share-alike, no non-commercial, no
no-derivatives — the last two aren't free licences at all and NC would rule out ever charging for
this.

1. Find the image on Commons and check `License` in its file metadata.
2. Crop to 3:2, save at 540x360, JPEG quality 70. Everything here lands between 25 and 60 KB.
3. Add it to `src/assets/cities/`, to `CITIES` in `src/data/cities.ts`, and to `PHOTO_CREDITS`
   in `src/data/credits.ts`. The credit line on the city page picks it up automatically.

Two traps worth knowing, both hit while assembling this set. Keyword search on Commons happily
returns 18th-century engravings and century-old black-and-white photographs, because they are
public domain and match the words; sampling the image's colour saturation rejects them without
guessing from titles. And a city's Wikipedia lead image is often a better single photograph than
anything keyword search finds — but check its licence, because plenty are share-alike.

## The better answer, eventually

Let people attach their own photo to a visit. Your picture of a city means more than the canonical
one, and it removes the licensing question entirely for everything except the default a city shows
before anyone has been.
